# Sound JavaScript

I almost barfed the other day when I tried TypeScript. I built up enough courage to go over to the dark side and try a Microsoft product. Everything seemed great. I got a Redux project up and running and when I opened up the browser... a runtime exception! The whole point of a compiler is to prevent runtime exceptions. And this is why I've decided to adventure off into the world of sound type systems.

So why not Elm or PureScript? Both languages are super cool but both have some parts I'm not as excited about. PureScript uses Bower -- ew! And neither have easy interoperability with external JavaScript libraries. I had a conversation with @chenglou and he absolutely sold me on Reason. So here we go:

## Getting Started

If you're getting started from absolutely nothing on a Mac, the following will get you set up. But it's likely you've already done this:

```sh
# install developer tools
xcode-select --install
# install homebrew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# install node and npm
brew install node
# install atom editor
brew cask install atom
```

These are the necessary tools that are specific to Reason that you probably don't have yet:

```sh
# install ninja
brew install ninja
# install and build the reason cli tools
npm install -g git://github.com/reasonml/reason-cli.git
# install the atom editor plugin along with a bunch of other facebook tooling
apm install nuclide
```

Nuclide is going to mess with your Atom UI so you can go to `Settings > Packages`, search for "nuclide" and change the Nuclide Settings. I would try to leave as much there as possible -- you don't want to get stuck on this part trying to get your IDE to work. But if you must, somewhere towards the middle is a "Use" section with a bunch of check boxes. I *believe* you can turn everything off except for the following:

```
hyperclick
nuclide-code-format
nuclide-datatip
nuclide-definition-hyperclick
nuclide-language-reason
nuclide-ocaml
nuclide-type-hint
```

A few customizations I would recommend:

- go to the `nuclide-code-format` section and tick "format on save".
- go to the `hyperclick` section and change the the command to `control-click` so you can still use command-click for multiple cursors.

At the end of the day, there are 4 editor features that you should **make sure** are working:
- When you type some garbage syntax, there should be red lines with compile errors.
- When you hover over a variable (where you cursor isn't), a datatip shows up with the type signature of that variable.
- When you control-click on a variable, it will jump to the definition of that variable.
- When you change the whitespace in the file and hit save, everything reformats to the way it was before.

You might notice some errors in the editor already even with a fresh project. That's because the editor tools depend on the artifacts generated by the build system. So let's get this project running:

```sh
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run build
# in another tab
open src/index.html
```

This build system is actually two separate tools. We're using `bucklescript` to compile Reason => OCaml => JavaScript, and we're using `webpack` to bundle all the files together for the browser.

## Learning Reason

Reading through the docs is an invaluable experience. There's way more to learn than I'm able to spew on this page. Start at the [Reason homepage](http://facebook.github.io/reason/index.html) and I'd recommend reading the whole thing along with the [Modules section](http://facebook.github.io/reason/modules.html) twice. If you're coming from a JavaScript background, make sure you check out the [JavaScript comparison section](http://facebook.github.io/reason/javaScriptCompared.html).

Reason has a package called [Rehydrate](https://github.com/reasonml/rehydrate) with type definitions for React along with an idiomatic API for creating React components. You'll definitely want to carefully read through the [Rehydrate docs](https://github.com/reasonml/rehydrate/blob/master/documentation.md).

Make sure you understand how JSX works -- it basically just calls the `createElement` function inside a module with labelled arguments.

The `updater` function is an interesting piece. We're going to take a closer look at it later, but it basically just memoizes a reference to the function you pass it so the components can be lazy. The other piece that's nice is it expects an `option state` return type. If you want to update the state, you can simply return a new state without ever having to call `setState`. This approach, along with the `componentBag` that gets passed around let's you write pure functions everywhere which is great!

You don't need to read this right now, but when you start getting into JS interop stuff, all of that happens with [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript). You can read [the docs](https://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html) but it's probably not all that helpful to you yet.

## Examples

Check out the [`src/tutorial.re`](./src/tutorial.re). I've built up a few different examples that you can check out in your browser.

Here are some other places you can find some examples:
