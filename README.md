# Cube [Demo](http://www.chetcorcos.com/cube/)

WARNING: this won't just work. I've had to make some changes to reactRe to fix some missing type annotations.

## To Do

- abstract the mouse and touch logic so everything works on mobile
- create listeners for the Drawing component and pass a drawBag to a prop to render child components
- create the drawing code, try to put on a cube, maybe just use firefox for the advanced mode
- PR for Reason and Rehydrate

- momentum
- add TODO's to Reason and Rehydrate
- render whatever you want inside each face
- webpack code splitting
- webpack asset handling (importing images, etc.)
