# Cube [Demo](http://www.chetcorcos.com/cube/)

## To Do

- momentum
- deploy to gh_pages

## Things to explore

- can I use other ocaml libraries?
- ocaml server? SSR?
- webpack code splitting
- webpack asset handling (importing images, etc.)

dependent types for typesafe matrix multiplication. cant do this: `tensor1d 'size = array float 'size;`

math functions here: http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html#TYPEfpclass


we need to convey this better though. That the js api you'd expect are all under Js.*
(and the experimental parts in ReasonJs)


Dash + OCaml docs

we try to stay ocaml. This way we contribute back

OCaml ppx macros
